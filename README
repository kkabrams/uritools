This is a handy little program to help you handle URIs that any program may want a handler for.
Just point those programs looking for a handler at uristart.

Then write a matching pattern, and a handler pipeline.

The matching patterns are a series of pairs of URI-piece and a string.

Each piece has a single letter you use to select the piece.

here's an example that uses all of the parts:
s://u:k@d:P/p?q#f

where each piece is:
s: scheme
u: username
k: password (k for key)
d: domain
P: port
p: path
q: query_string
f: fragment_id
